Week 4 (Exercise 3)
===================

Consider the function `normalize` that takes as input a list of positive
numbers `numbers` and returns a list of numbers that are a fraction of the
maximum element in the list. Try to answer the questions without running the
code. Check your answers, then run the code for the ones you get wrong. You'll
learn the most this way, by figuring things out, instead of just running the
code and reading off the answers.

```python
def normalize(numbers):
    max_number = max(numbers)
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        numbers[i] /= float(max_number)
    return numbers
```

The code below tries to call `normalize` with one particular input. Answer the
next 5 questions based on the following code.

```python
try:
      normalize([0, 0, 0])
except ZeroDivisionError:
      print('Invalid maximum element')
```

Question 1
----------

Does the `try` block throw (also known as raise) an exception?

Answer
------
Yes

Question 2
----------

What is the name of the exception the code is trying to catch?

Answer
------
ZeroDivisionError

Question 3
----------

What is the output?

Answer
------
Invalid maximum element

Question 4
----------

Since we are dividing by the maximum element in a list of positive numbers, we
know that `normalize` will return a value between 0 and 1. What type of
condition is this?

Answer
------
post condition

Question 5
----------

We also know the result is not meaningful when the maximum element is 0, so we
want to ensure that the numbers in the list do not violate this. What type of
condition is this?

Answer
------
pre condition


Now assume the definition of the function `normalize` is rewritten as follows

```python
def normalize(numbers):
    max_number = max(numbers)
    assert(max_number != 0), "Cannot divide by 0"
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        numbers[i]  /= float(max_number)
        assert(0.0 <= numbers[i] <= 1.0), "output not between 0 and 1"
    return numbers
```

Answer the next 3 questions based on this code.

Question 6
----------

Which condition does the line `assert(max_number != 0)` correspond to?

Answer
------
pre condition

Question 7
----------

Which condition does the line `assert(0.0 <= numbers[i] <= 1.0)` correspond to?

Answer
------
post condition

Question 8
----------

What does the function call `normalize([0, 0, 0])` print out?

Answer
------
AssertionError: Cannot divide by 0
